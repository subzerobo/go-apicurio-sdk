**Go-APICURIO-SDK** is an open-source Go SDK for interacting with [Apicurio Schema Registry v3.0 APIs](https://www.apicur.io/). This library provides an idiomatic Go interface to manage schemas, validate data, and handle schema evolution in Go applications. It is designed to make it easy for developers to integrate the Apicurio Schema Registry into their Go-based microservices or event-driven systems.
